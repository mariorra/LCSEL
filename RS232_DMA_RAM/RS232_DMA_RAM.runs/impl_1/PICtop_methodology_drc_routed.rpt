2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock RS232_PHY/Clock_generator/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_out1_Clk_PIC_TOP and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_Clk_PIC_TOP and clk_out1_Clk_gen_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_Clk_PIC_TOP] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_Clk_gen_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_Clk_gen_1 and clk_out1_Clk_PIC_TOP are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_Clk_gen_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_Clk_PIC_TOP]
